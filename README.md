# Predicting-Insurance-Claim-Amounts

---->Introduction:
            In the healthcare industry, understanding the factors that influence medical insurance costs is crucial for both insurance providers and policyholders. With the increasing availability of data, machine learning techniques offer a powerful way to predict insurance charges based on individual characteristics such as age, body mass index (BMI), smoking habits, and more.This task focuses on using regression modeling to estimate the medical insurance claim amount for individuals based on their personal data. Accurate predictions can help insurance companies set fair premiums and assist individuals in understanding how their lifestyle choices impact healthcare expenses.

---->Problem Statement:
                The goal is to build a Linear Regression model that predicts the insurance charges (medical claim amount) a person is likely to incur, using features like:
Age
Sex
BMI
Children
Smoker
Region
Charges
---->Additionally, we aim to:
1.Explore how age, BMI, and smoking status influence insurance charges through visualizations.
2.Evaluate model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

By completing this task, we will gain insights into how personal and lifestyle factors drive insurance costs and how regression can be applied to real-world financial predictions.

---->Conclusion:
          In this project, we built a machine learning model using the Random Forest Regressor to predict medical insurance charges based on personal and lifestyle factors such as age, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and residential region.
ðŸ“Š Model Performance
.Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 2541.61
.Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 4677.69

These metrics indicate that the model predicts insurance charges with a high level of accuracy, with an average error of around $2,541 and a standard error of approximately $4,677, showing it is effective in handling a wide range of cases, including those with higher charges.
